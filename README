NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::INI::Baked - Add a baked version of your
    configuration to tree automatically

VERSION

    version 0.002001

SYNOPSIS

      # somewhere in dist.ini or even your bundle
      [INI::Baked]
      ; filename        = dist.ini.baked
      ; source_filename = dist.ini
    
      # and and
      dzil build
    
      # and and
      cat $MYDIST/dist.ini.baked  # yay

    Whether you wish to

      * Copy that file back to root/

      * Name that file dist.ini

      * Add/Not add the original dist.ini to your built code.

    All these choices are your discretion, and are presently expected to
    master other dzil plugins to make this possible.

    I recommend:

      * [CopyFilesFromBuild]

      * [CopyFilesFromRelease]

      * Passing exclude rules to [Git::GatherDir]

      * Passing exclude rules to [GatherDir]

    These will of course all still work, because source_filename is read
    directly from $zilla->root

    Patches to make it read from $zilla->files will be accepted, but YAGNI
    for now.
